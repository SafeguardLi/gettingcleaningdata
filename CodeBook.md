# Codebook for the Tidy Dataset Resulting from *run_analysis.R* (*average_analysis.txt*)

## General Information

The script *run_analysis.R* creates a tidy dataset called *average_analysis.txt* from the *UCI HAR Dataset*.  Detailed information on how to run *run_analysis.R* and how to read *average_analysis.txt* into R can be found in README.md.

I consider *average_analysis.txt* to be a tidy dataset, because it fulfills the three basic requirements of tidy data as described by Hadley Wickham (2014):
1. Each variable forms a column
2. Each observation forms a row
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.
